# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Purpose:

Determing the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. In addition, determing the current number of employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. All employees born within that timeframe are considered for a mentorship program, so employees who are close to retirement age can help prepare other employees to fill their positions.

## Results:

- There are currently 300,024 employees in the company.

- There are 90,398 employees who will be retiring within the near future.

- There are 1,941 employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.

- Most of the retiring employees hold Senior positions in the company. It will be even more important to ensure that the employees who will fill their positions are trained well to ensure the positions contiue to be run smoothly.

## Summary

There are 90,398 roles that will need to be filled once the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact.

Currently there are 1,941 retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next gen of Pewlett Hackard employees. If there are over 90,000 employees retiring they will need to setup the mentor program to assist will all of the mentorships. I believe the success of the mentorship program depends on if the retirees have available time (no final/important projects), how long the mentorship lasted, how many wanted to be involved and how many wanted to be mentored. Looking at the current analysis, those numbers may not be possible to mentor every new employee.
